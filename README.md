# "HJ-580XP" - A friendly introduction

*```A friendly introduction to "HJ-580XP" tiny BLE Module, resorces and example of use with Arduino Uno.```*

* Apart from its tiny 5*6.2mm size, this ble is also quite cheap but the best of all is that it runs on  2.5V - 3.7V and it has Ultra-low power consumption mode of 2uA - 11.5uA !!!

* Seems like to be one of the smallest BLE modules i've ever found out there on the Internet! and i feel amazing that i finally got it working after so many Issues and dificulties i came across, especially based on my experience with such so tiny electronics and my knowledge of electronics in general [...]

	|GND|P06| Enables Uart RX Pin|<sub><sup>d10, s6</sup></sub>|
	|D11|P05/RX|Receives From D11|<sub><sup>d10, s17</sup></sub>|

 ### ```Code Examples```
Some examples to get you started,  can be found under [this](https://github.com/GiorgosXou/BLEPad_UART) repository i forked <sub><sup>*```(in case of anything happening to the original one)```*</sup></sub> which ended up helping me create my own example, under the folder examples [here](/examples/BLE-HJ-580XP_jul07a/BLE-HJ-580XP_jul07a.ino) in this repository.

## ```‚ö†Ô∏è``` Caution  !!!

* <sup>Make sure you have "HJ-580**XP**" and not "HJ-580**LA**" version.</sup>
  * *```XP comes PREPROGRAMMED insted of LA which is not```*
  * *```In case you bought **LA** check this:``` [```video```](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71hdcDCAY7o )* ```.```<br><br>
 * <sup>It is called "HJ-580**XP**" althought seems like it's called "HJ-580**X**" too.</sup>
 * <sup>If **P06** is not grounded for at least  5ms before sending data from arduino's **D10** to **P05/RX** pin,  the data won't be read from the BLE.</sup>
 * <sup>As much as i can be aware, at least mine "HJ-580XP", doesn't look like the one on the [seller's image](/images/2.jpg) which is what it suposed to seem based on my search (it should have been black and with a tiny cut and etc.), which makes me think if that is the "HJ-580LA" version but programmed by them? doesn't "really" matter as it is the same in dimensions and has only minor and not that important deferences [...]</sup>
